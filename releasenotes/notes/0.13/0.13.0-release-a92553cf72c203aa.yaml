    The 0.13.0 release includes several new features and bug fixes. There are
    many big changes this release.

    For the transpiler we have switched the graph library used to build the
    :class:`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` class which is the underlying data
    structure behind all operations to be based on
    `retworkx <https://pypi.org/project/retworkx/>`_ for greatly improved
    performance. Circuit transpilation speed in the 0.13.0 release should
    be significanlty faster than in previous releases.

    A library of quantum circuits is introduced in
    :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library`, containing some circuits of interest.
    The contents of this library will grow over time. Each circuit can be
    executed on its own, or used as a building block in building larger
    circuits. With this, Qiskit's circuits no longer assume an implicit
    initial state of :math:`|0\rangle`, and will not be drawn with this
    initial state. The all-zero initial state is still assumed on a backend
    when a circuit is executed.

    There has been a significant simplification to the style in which Pulse
    instructions are built. Now, ``Command`` s are deprecated and a unified
    set of :py:class:`~qiskit.pulse.instruction.Instruction` s are supported.

    --- Quantum Info TODO ---

    This release also has vastly improved documentation across Qiskit,
    including improved documentation for the :mod:`qiskit.circuit`,
    :mod:`qiskit.pulse` and :mod:`qiskit.quantum_info` modules.

    For full details on all the changes made in this release see the detailed
    release notes below.
