    Fixed an issue in the :class:`.ApplyLayout` transpiler pass that was
    incorrectly applying a layout if the circuit was not the width of
    the target backend which was a requirement of the pass to function
    correctly. In these circumstances the pass will now correctly raise a
    :class:`.TranspilerError`.
